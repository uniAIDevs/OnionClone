You have been tasked with developing a comprehensive platform that allows users to securely scan and clone the content of .onion websites hosted on the dark web. This platform will serve as a critical tool for researchers, law enforcement, and security professionals who need to access, analyze, and preserve the data from these elusive and often illicit websites. To achieve this, the platform will incorporate key technical components such as a robust Tor proxy module to enable anonymous access to .onion websites, advanced web crawling and scraping capabilities to systematically scan and index the content, a website cloning engine to generate complete replicas of the scanned websites, a comprehensive reporting system to provide detailed information about the scanned websites, and a scalable and secure backend infrastructure to support the platform's operations. Additionally, the platform will include user management and access control, a well-documented API for integration with external systems, and robust monitoring and logging mechanisms to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
